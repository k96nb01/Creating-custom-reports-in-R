## Quarto Document

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. Things you write here will show up on the final document.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content (what you're reading right now) and the output of code chunks. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RSQLite)

con <- dbConnect(drv = SQLite(), 
                 dbname = "LIS_database.db", # The file that contains our database
                 extended_types = T) 

(Patient_table <- tbl(con, "Patient")) 

(J.Linnon <- 
  Patient_table %>% 
  filter(HospitalID == "7487648492") %>% 
  select(PatientId:dq2cd)
)
```

Well, that looks really messy, doesn't it? Often time in a Quarto document, you want to run the code, but not necessarily show the code. You can add options to executable code like this below. The code is the same except for the `#| echo: false` code at the very beginning. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
# This option hides the code from the final document, but shows the output of the code chunk.

library(tidyverse)
library(RSQLite)

con <- dbConnect(drv = SQLite(), 
                 dbname = "LIS_database.db", # The file that contains our database
                 extended_types = T) 

(Patient_table <- tbl(con, "Patient")) 

(J.Linnon <- 
  Patient_table %>% 
  filter(HospitalID == "7487648492") %>% 
  select(PatientId:dq2cd)
)
```

The `#| echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). This Quarto document is still very messy, though, so let's open Report #2 to see how a properly formatted document will look.
